# FirewallScriptMaker
Creates a script for firewall's during comp use.


# What it does:
Ask for team number
Ask for the ip's of the boxes, how many boxes, and to insert an X where the team number will go.

For each box, it will ask for a hostname, scored services, and any extra ports.

It will then ask if you want to test your rules (pfctl -f(SOMETHING))

Then ask if you want to enable or change your rules.
